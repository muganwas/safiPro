						<h3>RICE IMPORTS:</h3>
						<p>
							Uganda imports rice worth over 100 M US Dollars every year. The demand for rice is still high and despite local producers complementing the demand, they cannot cope up. The sector has attracted foreign companies like Kingdom rice to set up their own rice milling companies here.
